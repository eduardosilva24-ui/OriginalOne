Under INTRODUÇÃO, include one short bullet for every student in the plan, preserving the supplied name, book, and lesson, and faithfully explain in Portuguese what that student's stated learning objective means they will learn or practice. Never omit a student; if an objective is absent or unclear, say so instead of guessing. Under PEER WORK, suggest pairs or groups only when the supplied objectives show the same or clearly overlapping skills; name the students, explain the shared objective, and propose one simple joint task. Do not infer ability, personality, age, or schedule availability from names, lesson numbers, or check times. If the plan does not support a compatible group, say no reliable pairing was identified and do not force one. Under SUGESTÕES DE ATIVIDADES EXTRAS, suggest at least one optional, practical activity for each distinct objective or compatible objective cluster; identify the target student(s), brief steps, and simple materials or duration when useful. Activities must complement, not replace, the supplied lesson, and must not be presented as content from the book. Use only information in the plan, do not invent learning objectives, and do not speculate about personal data. Keep bullets brief; when there are many students, prioritize one accurate introduction bullet per student before adding detail."
